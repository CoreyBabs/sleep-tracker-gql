# sleep-tracker-backend

Backend in rust for an app to track sleeping.

This repo is temporary and should not be used independently. I am unsure of what framework to use for the frontend so I want to have a single source for the backend.

# TODO
  * Create basic cli for testing
  * Create logic for analytics (This will be handled cliemt side)
  
# Requirements
  * Store/Get sleep quality, amount on a day by day basis
  * Allow users to add custom tags to a day
  * Allow users to filter by time or tag
  * Generate statistics based on sleep time, quality, tags, or calendar time.
